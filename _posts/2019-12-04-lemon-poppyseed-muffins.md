There's magic in these muffins. I can attempt all I want to explain exactly why they're so amazing, but you won't really know until you try them yourself.

Something about gluten-free muffins always seems a little bit off. Often times, they're a little too dense. They lack that quintessential muffin crumb and fluff. Maybe someday I'll conduct a full-blown experiment investigating what exactly gives these muffins their spirited lift. For now, I just have some strong hunches.

The first thing that I've found is that oat flour tends to absorb a *ton* of water. Whenever you're using oat flour to make muffins or bread, make sure it seems unreasonably dry. Like, "this seems like a pretty loose cookie dough" dry. Therefore, pure oat flour goodies tend to come out dense and seemingly undercooked (and no matter how much additional time it spends in the oven, it doesn't get better).

On the other hand, almond flour is much higher in fat concentration, and it often loses that starchy spring. If you don't let it fully cool, it's prone to falling apart. There are amazing tips online that dive deep into https://sugarfreesprinkles.com/how-to-bake-with-almond-flour/ this,
