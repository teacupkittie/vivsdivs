title:  Fruit & vegetable blob emojis for Discord
tags: art
---
A dear friend of mine graced me with a Discord Nitro gift for my birthday month (July!), which ultimately prompted and catalyzed the creation of these fruit and vegetable blob emojis. The day after I received the gift, I started aggressively joining servers to use their emotes globally. Then, I noticed that Blob Hub Studios was actively accepting pack submissions and that there was a crucial demand in the market for fruit blobs, so I took the plunge.

Join my <a class="bloglink" href="https://discord.gg/AA2pvSU">Discord server</a> and use these blob emojis for your self (global use only available for Nitro users)! Additionally, my blobs are copyrighted by Blob Hub Studios. Join the <a class="bloglink" href="https://discord.gg/yATKMY8">larger network</a>, too, which is home to over 12,000 unique blobs. Since submitting this pack, I've been named a Blob Designer as part of the Blob Hub Staff. Below are some of my favorite emojis I've created!
