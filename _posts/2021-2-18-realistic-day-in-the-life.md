title: A realistic day in the life of a senioritis patient

excerpt: I'm a frequent culprit of writing overly optimistic and ambitious to-do lists. On that fateful Sunday, Jan. 10, 2021, I once more set out to do more than I was realistically capable. Within the first few hours, I could feel myself falling behind. I came up with the brilliant idea to record what *actually* happened that day, as some sort of comic relief. You could arguably call it yet another procrastination ploy.
