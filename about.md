# About Me

I’m Vivian, and I’m currently a high school student and aspiring journalist based in Maryland. As a STEM student, I love all things environmental science and biology, but I’m an avid explorer of the intersection between writing and science as well. I consider myself a pretty big health nut, but that doesn’t stop me from baking up a storm in the kitchen. I also love fashion (especially sustainable fashion!) and you can check out my Depop shop for thrifted goods, where 100% of the proceeds go to funds in need. When I have time to spare, I enjoy embroidery, playing ukulele, and calligraphy. Finally, no matter how busy I get, I always make time to sing, run, and smile :)
